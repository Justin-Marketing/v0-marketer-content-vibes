# Justin Lesperance — Marketing, Web, & Content Portfolio

A selection of my work across web design, social media, campaigns, content marketing, advertising, and print.
My work focuses on audience-first storytelling, strong creative direction, and measurable business impact.

## Web Design

### LEA Professional
Website: https://www.leaprofessional.com

I built the LEA Professional website from the ground up for a new startup in the Pro AV space.
LEA was the first IoT-enabled professional amplifier, positioned as a "Smart Amp."

The goal of the website was to move away from the traditional corporate AV aesthetic
and instead create a modern, smart-tech visual language that clearly communicated
complex IoT value in an approachable way.

## Social Media

### Influencer Collaborations

I worked directly with one of the industry's largest YouTube influencers to create
multiple pieces of content. This holiday-themed video featured the influencer playing
a Christmas song on one of our flagship products.

The objective was to leverage the influencer's existing audience to expand brand reach
and grow our own social media channels.

I created these cinemagraphs using stock footage of ocean waves and composited them
into polished product photography to create scroll-stopping social media posts.

## Campaigns

### Happy New Gear (Social Campaign)

I planned and executed a user-generated content campaign encouraging customers to
submit photos of themselves with their newly purchased gear. Submissions were featured
throughout the Christmas season to spread holiday cheer while subtly promoting the brand.

### Happy New Gear (Landing Page)

This is the campaign landing page where I wrote the copy and helped guide the overall
experience for the user-generated content initiative.

### Free LEA Professional Stickers

user-generated content on social media.
